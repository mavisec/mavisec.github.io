          More than 95 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Azure! Azure AD is one of world&amp;rsquo;s largest web-based identity provider. Having the ability to understand and hack (thus securing) Azure is a skill that is in huge demand. This blog covers the lab work done in Introduction to Azure Penetration Testing labs &amp;amp; training provided by Altered Security.
Discovery We just know the name of the target organization - RetailCorp. Let us check if the target organization is using Azure AD!

          Introduction to ShellShock ShellShock Vulnerability [CVE-2014-6271], also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the Unix Bash shell, the first of which was disclosed on 24 September 2014. Shellshock could enable an attacker to cause Bash to execute arbitrary commands and gain unauthorized access to many Internet-facing services, such as web servers, that use Bash to process requests.
Shellshock is a privilege escalation vulnerability that offers a way for users of a system to execute commands that should be unavailable to them.

          In this writeup i&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to exploit Buffer Overflow in FreeFloat FTP Server on windows. The vulnerable application is can be downloaded from Here.
The Freefloat FTP Server has many vulnerable parameters which can be useful to practice and we will choose one of them here to do a full exercise.
¬†Lab details Victim Machine: Windows XP SP1 x64 2003
Application: FreeFloat Ftp Server (Version 1.00)
Attacker Machine: Kali Linux 2021.

          Intro to Insecure deserialization Serialization is when an object in a programming language (say, a Java or PHP object) is converted into a format that can be stored or transferred. Whereas deserialization refers to the opposite: it‚Äôs when the serialized object is read from a file or the network and converted back into an object.
Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities happen when applications deserialize objects without proper sanitization. An attacker can then manipulate serialized objects to change the program‚Äôs flow.

          Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications‚Äîwhich may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet). In this blog we&amp;rsquo;ll try to get remote code execution by exploiting MSSQL.

          Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. &amp;hellip; The word steganography is derived from the Greek words steganos (meaning hidden or covered) and the Greek root graph (meaning to write) - Wikipedia.
In this post, we are going to describe solutions to the KRACK-JIIT CTF 2019 Organized by JIIT Open Dev Circle (jodc).
