I’ll keep this blog straight to the point — no fluff. I won’t waste time explaining what the OSCP is, because if you’re reading this, you probably already know. You’re here to see how I passed it, and that’s exactly what I’m going to share.

<br/>

<hr />      
<h2 id="Why">🧠 Why I Took the OSCP</h2>
<p>Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always been into computers. But not just in the regular way — I had that break-in mentality. I was the kind of person who liked figuring out how things work by breaking them apart.

I was always intrigued by hacking — not just the cool visuals you see in movies, but the real process. How do people actually break into systems? What tools do they use? What mindset does it take?

That curiosity stayed with me.

Eventually, I discovered the OSCP. It wasn’t just another certification — it was the certification. The one that separates people who study from people who do. The one with the motto that hits you hard: "Try Harder."

<br/><br/>

<hr />
<h2 id="#SY0">🧰 My Preparation Journey</h2>
<p>I had actually taken the OSCP once before — back in 2022 — but didn’t pass.

After that, I lost motivation. I got caught up with studies and life in general, and my OSCP prep got pushed to the side.

But about two months ago, I decided to restart the journey — this time, with a different approach.

I knew my weak point was Active Directory, so I made it the main focus of my preparation. Instead of just grinding boxes, I worked on understanding the logic and flow behind AD attacks.

Here’s what helped me the most:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>OffSec’s official courseware and updated PWK labs</p></a></li>
<li><p>Proving Grounds Practice and PG Play for real-world-style machines</p></a></li>
<li><p>I solved all of LainKusanagi and TJNull list of OSCP like machines</p></a></li>
<li><p>I managed all my notes and tracking inside Notion — clean, organized, and always accessible</p></a></li>
<li>I also used external resources to build out my own personal cheatsheet, combining content from:
    <ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.emmanuelsolis.com/oscp.html" target="_blank">Emmanuel Solis’s OSCP Notes</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Ayz/OSCP" target="_blank">Daniel Ayz’s GitHub OSCP Notes</a> </li>
    </ul>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="Exam">🧪 Exam Day: From Stuck to Passed in 12 Hours</h2>
<p>I scheduled my exam for 1 PM so I’d have the night if needed, but could start fresh during the day.</p>
	<h3 id="">🔐 1:00 PM – Started with AD</h3>
<p>I began the exam with the Active Directory (AD) set, and within 15 minutes, I already had the first user flag for 10 points. That initial confidence boost was real — but it didn’t last.<br/>

After that quick win, I hit a wall.<br/>

I was stuck.<br/>
For 3 hours straight.<br/>

Nothing I tried was working. I went through everything — checked BloodHound, re-ran enumeration, second-guessed myself. Still nothing. It started getting frustrating.<br/>

So I did what saved my exam:<br/>
I took a break.<br/>

After stepping away for a bit, I came back with a fresh mindset, reversed my earlier approach, and found the answer that had been staring me in the face.<br/><br/>

Within 30 minutes, I had pwned the entire AD set, bringing my total up to 40 points by around 5 PM.</p>

<h3 id="">💻 5:00–8:00 PM – Standalone Machines</h3>
<p>Next, I shifted my focus to the standalone machines.<br/>

I gained initial access on one of them and got the user flag in about 30 minutes. But once again, privilege escalation hit me like a wall. I couldn’t figure it out.<br/>

Instead of wasting energy, I took another short break, came back with a clearer head, and this time I cracked it.<br/>

Another 10 points added.<br/>

By 8 PM, I was sitting at 60 points — just 10 away from passing.</p>


<h3 id="">🍽️ 8:00–11:30 PM – Final Push</h3>
<p>With only two boxes left and 10 points to go, I went back to my enumeration methodology and dug into them.<br/>

But again, I couldn’t find anything. I felt mentally drained.<br/>

So I took another break — this time a short nap and had dinner.<br/>

That reset worked wonders. I came back feeling sharp, re-ran some scans, and boom — I got access to one of the remaining machines. It all clicked into place.<br/>

By 11:30 PM, I had my 70 points — enough to pass the exam.</p>

<h3 id="">🧾 11:30 PM Onward – Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>At that point, I could’ve rushed and ended the exam early. But I didn’t want to risk anything.<br/>

Instead, I:<br/>

Submitted all my flags carefully<br/>

Double-checked every screenshot<br/>

Documented every step properly<br/>

I went to sleep peacefully that night.<br/>

The next morning, I triple-checked everything — screenshots, proof, timestamps — and finally submitted my report with full confidence.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="final">🎯 Final Tips & Motivation for OSCP Candidates</h2>
<p>If you’re starting your OSCP journey, here’s my raw advice:</p>

<p><strong>Practice. Practice. Practice.</strong><br>
Solving machines builds not just skill — but speed, habit, and confidence.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t worry if you feel lost.</strong><br>
I used to look at walkthroughs and feel like I’d never get it. I’ve been that person too. But I kept going — and now I’m certified.</p>

<p><strong>Use walkthroughs smartly.</strong><br>
Learn why every step works. Eventually, you’ll stop needing them.</p>

<p><strong>Believe in yourself.</strong><br>
If I can do it, you absolutely can too.</p>

<p>The OSCP isn’t just about hacking machines. It’s about failing, learning, and coming back stronger every time.</p>

<p><strong>Try harder. Then try smarter. And don’t stop.</strong></p>
